# SentinelShield – AI-Powered Smart Pendant for Women’s Safety

SentinelShield is a wearable AI-based emergency alert system. It detects custom tap patterns or voice cues to silently trigger emergency alerts, ensuring quick help without needing a phone unlock or app navigation.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Designed for women's safety, SentinelShield sends real-time alerts to:
- 5 trusted contacts
- Local police (via integration)
- Developers (for analytics/response)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Backend logic
- **Twilio API** – Sends SMS and voice alerts
- **Firebase** – Stores user, location, and emergency data
- **Simple ML Model** – Detects tap/voice patterns

## 🛠️ Files

- `main.py` – Core logic (pattern detection + trigger)
- `firebase_config.py` – Firebase initialization
- `twilio_alert.py` – Sends alerts via Twilio
- `README.md` – This file

## 🔐 Real-Time Usage

Used in emergencies like:
- Physical assault or rape threat
- Elderly fall detection
- Discreet help trigger (hands-free)

## 📈 Future Scope

- Add wearable device integration (Bluetooth)
- NLP voice detection with AI analysis
- Geo-fencing with auto-activation
